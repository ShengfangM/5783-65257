# This repository is created for the assignment 3 of course CS5783. The code and report are in the 'Assignment3_5783_Ma.ipynb' file.
# Please pay attention that the code of the question 2 in the assignment3 is relative time consuming.  To test the effect of learning rate and effect of batch size, the LeNet model trained in 12  different learning rates and 8 different batch sizes. So the whole training process of LeNet model loop 12 times to get the effect of learning rate  and 8 times to get the size of batch size.
